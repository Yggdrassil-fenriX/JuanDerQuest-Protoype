# JuanDerQuest

**Tagline:** *Every JuanDer Counts.*

## 🌍 Executive Summary

JuanDerQuest is a gamified, blockchain-powered eco-tourism platform designed for tourists and locals, collectively called **JuanDerers**. It rewards eco-conscious behaviors like trash collection, tree planting, or cultural visits with tokens validated by smart contracts. These tokens, called **JDQ** (JuanDererQuest), follow the **VRC-25** standard on **Viction**blockchain. JDQ can be used for merchant discounts, heritage donations, or in-app progression. The app integrates sustainability, gamification, and decentralized governance to boost grassroots eco-tourism in Pangasinan.

### 2. 🎮 Eco Leveling System

- XP gained per eco-action.
- Unlocks NFT badges, harder quests, and community titles.

### 3. 🪙 Token Utility

- Spend JDQ on partner shop discounts.
- Donate JDQ to heritage sites.
- Stake JDQ in DAO voting.
- Watch ads to multiply JDQ rewards.

### 4. 📍 Location-Based Experiences

- GPS triggers site-specific content (quizzes, trivia).
- Example: Complete mangrove quiz at Alimango Restaurant for bonus JDQ.

### 5. 🏆 Special & Scheduled Quests

- NGO-partnered missions: tree planting, coastal cleanups, field trips.
- Events are time-based and limited.
- JDQ airdrops are issued to verified participants.

### 6. 🏆 Special & Scheduled Quests

- NGO-partnered missions: tree planting, coastal cleanups, field trips.
- Events are time-based and limited.
- JDQ airdrops are issued to verified participants.

### 7. 🪪 Collectible Badges & NFTs (Proof-of-Impact Rewards)

- JuanDerers earn **soulbound NFTs** (non-transferable) as proof of completed milestones.
- Each badge symbolizes real-world contributions and unlocks prestige, bragging rights, and potential quest perks.
- NFTs are stored in-app and on-chain — visible on user profiles and DAO leaderboards.

**Sample Badges:**

- 🐚 **Baewatcher** – For completing 5 coastal cleanup quests
- 🌳 **Gubatron** – Earned after 3 tree planting missions
- 🧭 **JuanDerFull** – Awarded to Juanderers who complete all quests across Pangasinan

> These badges are more than flex material — they’re soulbound proof that you’ve actually made a difference.

## 👥 Ecosystem & Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **JuanDerers** | Complete quests, earn JDQ, stake votes |
| **NGOs** | Host events, verify actions, distribute JDQ |
| **Schools** | Organize field-trip quests, co-host learning experiences |
| **Shops** | Accept JDQ for goods/services, sponsor quests, buy ads with JDQ |
| **Heritage Sites** | Receive JDQ donations, participate in gamified education |
| **Platform/DAO** | Handle treasury, smart contracts, infrastructure |

---

## 🤝 Merchants as Advertisers (Token-for-Ad Model)

- Merchants earn JDQ from user redemptions.
- Instead of cashing out, they spend JDQ on in-game promotions:
    - Map banners
    - Sponsored quests
    - Bonus token multipliers
- Zero-fiat barrier encourages small/local vendors to participate.

---

## 🔗 Smart Contract Use Cases

- **Token Minting**: Triggered via verified quests.
- **Proof-of-Visit**: NFTs issued after verified eco actions.
- **Shop Redemption**: Merchants receive JDQ and reinvest them into ad placements.
- **Donation Contracts**: On-chain JDQ donations to heritage sites.

## 🗾️ Revenue Model

| Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Ads** | Eco brands sponsor videos/quests |
| **Token Top-ups** | Users buy JDQ via GCash, crypto, etc. |
| **NGO Funding** | CSR/ESG grants fund ecosystem |
| **Token-for-Ad Loop** | Merchants recycle earned JDQ into visibility |

**CSR (***Corporate Social Responsibility***)/ESG grant support (***Environmental, Social, and Governance)***:** NGOs or eco-conscious brands may help fund JDQ ecosystems as part of their sustainability efforts. It means that **real-world NGOs or companies** (like SM Foundation, Jollibee Group Foundation, Shell, Globe, etc.) could provide *funding support* — not tokens — to help jumpstart JDQ reward pools, events, or platform expansion. *(Funding may be in fiat or crypto, but tokens remain JDQ on VRC-25.)*

## 🧠 Decentralized Tourism DAO (Stake-to-Vote Model)

### How It Works:

1. User discovers hidden spot.
2. Stakes JDQ with photo + writeup to propose it.
3. Community votes via staked JDQ (SBT-gated).
4. Winning proposals are verified and unlocked as quests.
5. DAO disburses JDQ to NGOs for site development.

| Role | Power |
| --- | --- |
| **Tourist** | Propose/vote on new destinations |
| **Resident** | Vote to elevate local spots |
| **NGOs** | Review, validate, and trigger development |

**Safeguards**:

- SBTs required to vote (Sybil protection).
- JDQ votes are locked or burned (token sink).
- NGOs act as primary validators — not LGUs.

## 🔄 DAO Pool Allocation

| Category | % | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Burn | 10% | Reduce supply, preserve JDQ value |
| Proposer | 25% | Incentivize discoverers |
| NGO Dev Fund | 60% | Real-world impact |
| Platform Fee | 5% | Maintenance, audits, updates |
